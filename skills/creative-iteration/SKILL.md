description: Improve an image or video that Sloosh already made and the user has seen, in up to 3 rounds. It fixes one thing with an edit, re-rolls near a good option, blends two results, tries another model or seed, or goes back a step, with a quote for each round. Use when the user reacts to a Sloosh result, such as "the label is wrong", "more like the second one", "try again but warmer" or "make the video slower", and the Sloosh tools are connected. Not for a first image or clip (use product-imagery or product-video), and not for a retouch of a photo or a change to a clip the user brought (use the sloosh-image image-edit-retouch skill or the sloosh-video video-extend-edit skill if it is installed).

# Creative iteration

Use this skill to improve a Sloosh result the user has already seen. Each round makes one focused change, keeps what worked and gets its own quote. The tool descriptions and the server's instructions decide how each tool works. If this skill differs from a tool description or a server guide, follow the server.

## Before you start

- If the Sloosh tools are not available (no `get_connection`, `quote_generation` or `generate` tool), tell the user to install and connect the core Sloosh plugin. Then stop.
    - Claude Code: run /plugin install sloosh@sloosh, then run /mcp and sign in.
    - Claude app: open the plugin's Connectors tab and connect Sloosh. Or add a custom connector with the URL https://mcp.sloosh.ai/mcp.
- Call `get_connection` once in the conversation if you have not called it yet. If spending is not enabled, give the user the settings link it returns and do no paid work.
- If a brand kit exists, read it: a sloosh-brand.md file, Project knowledge, memory or pasted brand text. Keep its colours, voice and claims in every fix.
- If the user adds a new reference in a round, ask the user to confirm they may use it. This applies to a photo of a person, a third-party image, a reference ad or a style reference. An asset name, a file name, workspace data or the word 'my' is not confirmation. Ask the user and wait for a clear answer before any quote. Do not use a photo of a child or of a public figure as a person reference. If the user declines or cannot confirm, explain why and stop.

## Steps

1. Find the result. For a generated asset named in a card message, call `get_asset` with its kind and id. Use the returned URL. Reuse other assets from `list_assets`. Call `import_asset` for a public HTTPS URL. For a local file, follow the server's upload instruction for this client. A Sloosh output has kind generated. A file the user uploaded or imported has kind workspace. If `get_asset` or `view_asset` returns asset not found, try once with the other kind.
2. Look at the result with `view_asset`. For a video, `view_asset` has no preview. Ask the user what they see in the card, or look at the start-frame still if one exists. Name the defect or the wish in one sentence. Say what changes and what stays. Ask the user to confirm.
3. Get the original prompt and settings from the conversation. The `quote_generation` result repeats them in its input. If they are lost, write the prompt again from what you see. Ask the user for the model and the seed if they matter.
4. Classify the feedback and choose one route: edit one thing, shift the feel, re-roll near a good result, blend two results, edit or extend a clip, or go back a step. Read `references/routes.md` for the route table, the model choice and the prompt skeletons.
5. If the direction is wrong, do not patch. Follow the `product-imagery` or `product-video` skill with the corrected brief. For a set of ad sizes, follow the `ad-variants` skill.
6. If the user wants many directions from one image, or the same defect came back after a round, search `list_spaces` for a Space built for it. Search for terms such as variation grid, relight or skin retouch. Choose by the description from `get_space`. Use the Space path below. If no Space fits, use the direct path. Before you take the direct path, call `get_space` on the best one or two matches from `list_spaces`. Tell the user in one line why no Space fits.
7. Write the fix prompt. Keep the exact-keep lines of the original prompt. For a short or vague change, call `enhance_prompt`. Show the user the rewrite. Do not call it for a video edit or extend.

## Direct path

1. Call `list_models` with the mode the route needs: `image_gen`, `video_gen`, `video_edit` or `video_extend`. Pick the model as `references/routes.md` says. Pick by the limits the brief needs. Do not call a model cheap, fast or best because of its description. To compare price, quote two or three models that fit with the same settings, and say a model is cheapest only among the models you quoted. For a round, compare on one item, then quote the rest with the chosen model only. If a quote is rate limited, stop quoting and tell the user. Do not choose a model or estimate a price from memory.
2. Call `quote_generation` with the same mode you passed to `list_models`, the prompt, the model, the aspect ratio and the result as an asset. For a video edit or extend, pass the clip as the one source video. For a remade clip, pass the best still with the start-frame role. Quote with enhancePrompt false, so the change and keep lines reach the model unchanged.
3. Show the credits and the change in plain words. The allowance left from `get_connection` is in millicredits. Divide it by 1000 to get credits. If the quote is more, give the user the settings link and do not run.
4. Ask the user to approve this quote. Wait for the user.
5. Call `generate` with the quote and a new idempotency key for this round, for example `iterate-serum-hero-1x1-v2`. Set confirmed=true only after the user approves this quote.
6. If `show_generation` is available, call `show_generation` once with the operation ids of the round, up to 8. Show images and videos in separate calls. If not, check the status with `get_generation` at the interval the server gives. Do not use a shell sleep to wait. If it is still running after a few checks, tell the user and check again when they reply. If the user asks to see a result again, give its link or look at it with `view_asset`. Do not call `show_generation` again for the same operation.

For quote expiry and card actions, read the `generation` and `spending` guides with `get_guide`.

## Space path

1. Call `get_space_input_schema` for the chosen Space. Map the result and the change to its field ids. Ask only for missing fields.
2. Call `quote_space` with the inputs. Tell the user the expected credits and the maximum the run can hold.
3. Ask the user to approve this quote. Wait for the user.
4. Call `run_space` with the quote and a stable idempotency key, for example `iterate-serum-hero-grid-v1`. Set confirmed=true only after the user approves this quote.
5. If `show_generation` is available, call `show_generation` once with the run's operation id. Show the Space run on its own. If not, check the status with `get_space_run` at the interval the server gives. Do not use a shell sleep to wait. If it is still running after a few checks, tell the user and check again when they reply.
6. If `get_space_run` shows a checkpoint, show the user what it needs. Call `approve_space_checkpoint` or `reject_space_checkpoint` only when the user decides.
7. When the run finishes and the user wants the files, call `get_space_run_outputs`.

For checkpoints, holds and run states, read the `spaces` guide with `get_guide`.

## Check each round

1. When the round has finished, call `get_generation` once with the operation id. Pass each output's generation id with kind generated to `view_asset`.
2. Compare the new result with the earlier one on the change and on everything that must stay. For a video, ask the user what they see in the card.
3. Tell the user in one line what changed, what stayed and what you checked. Keep the earlier result.
4. For a 9:16 ad or social placement, keep the product and any text out of the top 14%, the bottom 35% and 6% at each side.
5. After 3 rounds that do not pass, stop. Show the best version. Say what the model cannot hold. Offer another model, a Space or a manual edit.

## When a run delivers nothing

- A run can settle with nothing delivered because a reference photo shows a real person who is not verified yet. The same key returns the same result. Wait about a minute. Then get a fresh quote, ask for a new approval and use a new key. Do this once. If it fails again, tell the user and stop.

## Spending rules

- Get a quote before any paid call. State its credits in plain words.
- If the quote has a warning, tell the user what it says before they approve.
- Plan at most 8 generations per round. Ask for one approval per round. If the total or the maximum hold is more than the allowance left, do not run.
- Wait for the user's approval of each quote. A changed prompt, model, Space or input needs a new quote and a new approval. So does an expired quote or a card's Recreate, Edit or Animate.
- Only a clear yes to the quote you showed is approval. A request to make something, a condition such as 'after you submit' or 'go ahead if it is cheap', or a yes to an earlier quote is not approval. If a quote expires, get a new quote and ask again. Never promise to run a new quote without a new approval.
- Start each idempotency key with iterate-. Build it from the product, variant, aspect ratio and round. Never reuse a key across different quotes. Do not make a new key to retry. A changed request needs a new key. This new key is not a retry.
- If a call reports an idempotency conflict, do not make a new key. The first request may already have run. Call `get_generation` with its original operation id, or `reconcile_generation` if it is available. For a Space run, use `reconcile_space_run`. Act on what it shows.
- If the owner phase is rejected, nothing ran and nothing was charged. Follow the notice in the result. Only this case and the real person case need a new quote, a new approval and a new key.
- If a call fails because the service owner is unavailable, retry once with the same key. If it fails again, tell the user and stop.
- If the result of a call is unclear, read it with `get_generation`, `reconcile_generation` or `reconcile_space_run` before you retry.
- For any other error, read the `recovery` guide with `get_guide` before you act. Retry at most once.
