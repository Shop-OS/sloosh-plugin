description: Make new product photos with Sloosh, such as studio packshots, lifestyle scenes and hero shots of the user's own product, with the label, logo, colour and shape kept exact. Use when the user asks for a product image, a packshot, a lifestyle shot, a hero image, to put their product in a new scene or to improve an image prompt, and the Sloosh tools are connected. Not for ad sets with copy or several placement sizes (use ad-variants), for video (use product-video) or for changes to an image Sloosh already made (use creative-iteration). For shots of several products from a Shopify store, use the sloosh-shopify catalog-shoot skill if it is installed. For angle sets, colourways or marketplace white-background checks, use the sloosh-ecommerce skills if they are installed. To place a photo into a supplied scene photo and relight it, to shoot in the look of style references, or to edit, reframe or upscale an existing image, use the sloosh-image skills if they are installed.

# Product imagery

Use this skill to plan a Sloosh image request: one to four product photos, such as a packshot, a lifestyle scene or a hero shot. The tool descriptions and the server's instructions decide how each tool works. If this skill differs from a tool description or a server guide, follow the server.

## Before you start

- If the Sloosh tools are not available (no `get_connection`, `quote_generation` or `generate` tool), tell the user to install and connect the core Sloosh plugin. Then stop.
    - Claude Code: run /plugin install sloosh@sloosh, then run /mcp and sign in.
    - Claude app: open the plugin's Connectors tab and connect Sloosh. Or add a custom connector with the URL https://mcp.sloosh.ai/mcp.
- If a brand kit exists, read it: a sloosh-brand.md file, Project knowledge, memory or pasted brand text. Use its colours, style and brand line in the prompt.
- If the user gives a photo of a person, a third-party image or a style reference, ask the user to confirm they may use it. For a person, ask the user to confirm that the person agreed to appear in an AI-made image. An asset name, a file name, workspace data or the word 'my' is not confirmation. Ask the user and wait for a clear answer before any quote. Do not use a photo of a child or of a public figure. If the user declines or cannot confirm, explain why and stop.

## Steps

1. Call `get_connection` once in the conversation if you have not called it yet. If spending is not enabled, give the user the settings link it returns and do no paid work.
2. Collect the brief: the product, the scene or background, the light, the aspect ratio and how many images (1 to 4). Ask only for what is missing. If the user gives no scene, offer a studio packshot on white.
3. Find the reference images, if any:
    - For a local file, follow the server's upload instruction for this client.
    - For a public HTTPS image URL, use `import_asset`.
    - For an image already in Sloosh, find it with `list_assets` or `get_asset`.
    - To judge a reference image, look at it with `view_asset`.
    - A Sloosh output has kind generated. A file the user uploaded or imported has kind workspace. If `get_asset` or `view_asset` returns asset not found, try once with the other kind.
4. Look at the product photo with `view_asset`. List what must stay exact: the label text, the logo, the colours and the shape. Tell the user this list in one line.
5. Call `list_models` with mode `image_gen`. Pick a model whose limits fit the brief, such as reference image count and aspect ratio. Do not call a model cheap, fast or best because of its description. To compare price, quote two or three models that fit with the same settings, and say a model is cheapest only among the models you quoted. For a round, compare on one item, then quote the rest with the chosen model only. If a quote is rate limited, stop quoting and tell the user. Do not choose a model or estimate a price from memory.
6. Write the prompt from the craft rules below. If the prompt is short or vague, or the user asks to improve it, call `enhance_prompt` with the prompt, the mode, the model settings and the number of reference images. It is free. Show the user the rewritten prompt and let them change it. If `enhance_prompt` fails, follow its error. Then use your own prompt.
7. Call `quote_generation` for the brief. Set enhancePrompt to false, so the approved prompt and its keep line reach the model word for word. Use one quote for each distinct prompt or aspect ratio. One prompt with up to 4 images needs one quote.
8. Tell the user the credits and what they will get. If the quote returns a budget and its fitsDailyLimit is false, give the user the budget's settings link and do not run. The allowance left from `get_connection` is in millicredits. Divide it by 1000 to get credits before you compare it with the quote. Wait for the user to approve.
9. Call `generate` with the quote and a stable idempotency key, for example `imagery-bottle-white-1x1-v1`. Set confirmed=true only after the user approves this quote.
10. If `show_generation` is available, call `show_generation` once with the operation id. If not, check the status with `get_generation` at the interval the server gives. Do not use a shell sleep to wait. If it is still running after a few checks, tell the user and check again when they reply. For several generations, make one card call after the last `generate` with all the operation ids. If the user asks to see a result again, give its link or look at it with `view_asset`. Do not call `show_generation` again for the same operation.
11. When owner.phase is settled, read the outputs. On the card path, call `get_generation` once when the card shows the run is done or the user asks. Check each output with `view_asset`, with kind generated and the output's generationId as the id. If the preview is not ready, follow the retry in the tool result. Check the label spelling, the logo shape, the colour, the proportions, the hands if any, and no extra text or extra products. Tell the user what passed and what you did not check.
12. For a near miss, follow the `creative-iteration` skill.
13. To animate a finished image, follow the `product-video` skill. For an ad set with copy or several placement sizes, follow the `ad-variants` skill. For a ready-made Space recipe, such as a product relit into a scene photo, follow the `published-spaces` skill.

For card actions, model choice or generation errors, read the `generation` guide with `get_guide`.

## Craft rules

- Build each prompt in this order: the subject, the setting, the light, the camera, the style, then the keep line. The prompt shape, the packshot, lifestyle and hero defaults, a worked example and the fixes for a warped label or shape are in `references/prompt-craft.md`.
- Name each reference by its role, such as "reference 1 is the product" and "reference 2 is the scene".
- Put the keep line in every prompt: "Keep the label text, logo, colours and shape exactly as in reference 1. No extra text, no extra products."
- Do not stack adjectives. Give one light direction and one lens.
- If results look generic, check the last prompt for a named reference, one light direction and one lens.
- Do not put words on the image. For copy on the image, hand off to the `ad-variants` skill.
- If the model does not list the aspect ratio you need, pick another model from `list_models` that lists it.
- For a 9:16 story or reel placement, keep the product out of the top 14%, the bottom 35% and 6% at each side of the frame.
- Explore with one small round first. Make more images only for the direction the user picks.
- If the user has no product photo, say the result is an illustration and not a photo of their product.

## When a run delivers nothing

- A run can settle with nothing delivered because a reference photo shows a real person who is not verified yet. The same key returns the same result. Wait about a minute. Then get a fresh quote, ask for a new approval and use a new key. Do this once. If it fails again, tell the user and stop.
- A run can settle with nothing delivered because a safety check blocked the output. Tell the user. Remove wording about people, bodies or medical claims. Then quote again, ask for a new approval and use a new key.

## Spending rules

- Get a quote before any paid call. State its credits in plain words.
- If the quote has a warning, tell the user what it says before they approve.
- Plan at most 8 generations per round. Ask for one approval per round. If the total is more than the allowance left, do not run.
- Wait for the user's approval of that quote. A changed brief, another model or an expired quote needs a new quote and a new approval.
- Only a clear yes to the quote you showed is approval. A request to make something, a condition such as 'after you submit' or 'go ahead if it is cheap', or a yes to an earlier quote is not approval. If a quote expires, get a new quote and ask again. Never promise to run a new quote without a new approval.
- Start each idempotency key with imagery- and build it from the product, variant and aspect ratio, for example `imagery-serum-slate-4x5-v1`. Use the same key when you retry the same request. Never reuse a key across different quotes. Do not make a new key to retry.
- If the owner phase is rejected, nothing ran and nothing was charged. Follow the notice in the result. Among retries, only this case and the real person case need a new quote, a new approval and a new key.
- If a call fails because the service owner is unavailable, retry once with the same key. If it fails again, tell the user and stop.
- If the result of a generation is unclear, use `reconcile_generation` before you retry.
- For any other error, read the `recovery` guide with `get_guide` before you act. Retry at most once.
